# Retail-Insights-Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle to extract actionable insights from large volumes of transactional data spread across regions, product categories, and customer segments. Without a consolidated, interactive view, decision-making around sales strategies, product performance, and regional operations becomes reactive instead of proactive.

This project addresses that challenge by developing an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides visibility into sales performance, product trends, and customer segments for the SuperStore dataset.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop – for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation  
- Excel / CSV – as the source of transactional and product data  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs  
- Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation

## Process Breakdown
1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Imported raw sales data (Orders, Products, Categories, Regions).  
   - Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query.  

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Built relationships between fact tables (Orders, Sales) and dimension tables (Products, Customers, Geography).  
   - Created calculated fields such as Revenue, Profit, and Segment-based metrics.  

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - Designed KPIs: Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Total Products.  
   - Created trend analysis visuals across months, quarters, and years.  
   - Developed geographical insights (Top States and Cities by Revenue).  
   - Built category and sub-category analysis (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies).  
   - Added customer segment insights (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).  

4. **Interactivity and Filters**
   - Implemented drill-downs by time, region, and product category.  
   - Added slicers for Year, Region, and Segment to enhance flexibility.
